## Log

### R1D1 Saturday April 27, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
- Went through "Applied Accesibility" on FreeCodeCamp.
- Set up a repo for building the Odin Project - Etch a Sketch Project.

**Learned:** 
- how screen readers work for visually impaired users
- how heading tags (h1, h2, h3) are read by screen readers, and how important it is to follow rules like only having one H1, then headers as H2, subheadings as H3 - it's about semantics, not style.
- what RSS feeds are
- the syntax and function of <figure> and <figcaption> for images/visual information - especially for explaining data visualisations for vision impaired users.
- specify things for screen readers only using CSS - e.g. a table of data for visually impaired users in place of the barchart image on the page
- the contrast ration of text and background shuld be at least 4.5:1
- use accesskeys to make links navigatable with keys more easily
- use tabindex attribute to designate the order of the focus of the screen reader

**Thoughts:** 
- surprised how fast screen readers audio is
- I should try setting up an RSS reader for collecting/keeping up with coding related news
