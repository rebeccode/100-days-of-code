## Log

### R2D7 Friday May 24, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Working on the Etch a Sketch Odin project

**Learned:** 
Managed to make the divs change color - it works!

**Thoughts:** 
I find JavaScript hard to think about - I think I need to slow down and figure out what I need to do and how - especially for the next steps for the reset button.

### R2D6 Thursday May 23, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Working on the Etch a Sketch Odin project

**Learned:** 
Why my JavaScript wasn't working - I was passing 'div' as a string, rather than the actual HTML tag in the function.
And I have to invokve the function - just declaring it won't make it run.

**Thoughts:** 
Odin's projects are hard! But I feel like I learn a lot by figuring things out by myself.

### R2D5 Wednesday May 22, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Working on the Second Responsive Web Design project from Free Code Camp - a survey form.

**Learned:** 
How to make form fields required, set min/max values, restrict the text/numbers that can be inputted using pattern="" and make a drop down list.

**Thoughts:** 
Making progress and learning basics still, but it feels good to keep learning.

### R2D4 Sunday May 19, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Completed and passed the tests for the first Responsive Web Design project from Free Code Camp - a tribute page.

**Learned:** 
Learn about SASS by watching a youtube video and then tried to use some of the features of SASS in this project.

**Thoughts:** 
I realise that it is hard to sort out layouts using different methods - floats, flexbox, CSS grid, etc. and I don't need to have it all in my mind and be able to write it perfectly instantly. I have way too high standards/expectations for myself.
Breaking it down and working it out on paper and trying it and testing it, then fixing it. That trial and error is totally fine while learning! Don't beat yourself up!

### R2D3 Tuesday May 7, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
- Went through "CSS Grid" on FreeCodeCamp (FCC)
- Come to my first FCC responsive project - a Tribute Page which I am working on now:
https://codepen.io/rebeccode/pen/qGELXG

**Learned:** 
That I'd forgotten a lot about CSS grid, but many of the concepts are very similar - like justify-self is for one item on the horizontal axis, justify-items is for all.
Align-self is for one item on the vertical axis and align-items is for all on the vertical axis.

**Thoughts:** 
Brining my laptop and studying at lunch at work today.
I was really ill for a week and couldn't go to work or do anything. I'm back today and starting where I left off.

I feel a kind of mental block when thinking about grids and laying out items. I think I should take pen to paper and plan carefully and think ahead for what I want to make when I go forward in the FCC projects.

### R2D2 Sunday April 28, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
- Went through "Flexbox" on FreeCodeCamp.
- Setting up the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files for the Odin Project Etch-a-Sketch project.

**Learned:** 
- justify content is along the main axis, and align-items is on the cross axis

**Thoughts:** 
- I've forgotten a lot of the basic JavaScript stuff I learned since I haven't looked at it for ages!

### R2D1 Saturday April 27, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
- Went through "Applied Accesibility" on FreeCodeCamp.
- Set up a repo for building the Odin Project - Etch a Sketch Project.

**Learned:** 
- how screen readers work for visually impaired users
- how heading tags (h1, h2, h3) are read by screen readers, and how important it is to follow rules like only having one H1, then headers as H2, subheadings as H3 - it's about semantics, not style.
- what RSS feeds are
- the syntax and function of <figure> and <figcaption> for images/visual information - especially for explaining data visualisations for vision impaired users.
- specify things for screen readers only using CSS - e.g. a table of data for visually impaired users in place of the barchart image on the page
- the contrast ration of text and background shuld be at least 4.5:1
- use accesskeys to make links navigatable with keys more easily
- use tabindex attribute to designate the order of the focus of the screen reader

**Thoughts:** 
- surprised how fast screen readers audio is
- I should try setting up an RSS reader for collecting/keeping up with coding related news
