### R1D3 Tuesday May 7, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
- Went through "CSS Grid" on FreeCodeCamp (FCC)
- Come to my first FCC responsive project - a Tribute Page which I am working on now:
https://codepen.io/rebeccode/pen/qGELXG

**Learned:** 
That I'd forgotten a lot about CSS grid, but many of the concepts are very similar - like justify-self is for one item on the horizontal axis, justify-items is for all.
Align-self is for one item on the vertical axis and align-items is for all on the vertical axis.

**Thoughts:** 
Brining my laptop and studying at lunch at work today.
I was really ill for a week and couldn't go to work or do anything. I'm back today and starting where I left off.

I feel a kind of mental block when thinking about grids and laying out items. I think I should take pen to paper and plan carefully and think ahead for what I want to make when I go forward in the FCC projects.

### R1D2 Sunday April 28, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
- Went through "Flexbox" on FreeCodeCamp.
- Setting up the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files for the Odin Project Etch-a-Sketch project.

**Learned:** 
- justify content is along the main axis, and align-items is on the cross axis

**Thoughts:** 
- I've forgotten a lot of the basic JavaScript stuff I learned since I haven't looked at it for ages!

### R1D1 Saturday April 27, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
- Went through "Applied Accesibility" on FreeCodeCamp.
- Set up a repo for building the Odin Project - Etch a Sketch Project.

**Learned:** 
- how screen readers work for visually impaired users
- how heading tags (h1, h2, h3) are read by screen readers, and how important it is to follow rules like only having one H1, then headers as H2, subheadings as H3 - it's about semantics, not style.
- what RSS feeds are
- the syntax and function of <figure> and <figcaption> for images/visual information - especially for explaining data visualisations for vision impaired users.
- specify things for screen readers only using CSS - e.g. a table of data for visually impaired users in place of the barchart image on the page
- the contrast ration of text and background shuld be at least 4.5:1
- use accesskeys to make links navigatable with keys more easily
- use tabindex attribute to designate the order of the focus of the screen reader

**Thoughts:** 
- surprised how fast screen readers audio is
- I should try setting up an RSS reader for collecting/keeping up with coding related news
