## Log

### R1D1 Saturday January 19th 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Cloned the 100 Days of Code repository to my local machine.
Working on the Odin Project Web Dev 101 - Dev Resources.
I reviewed some things about using Dev Tools and did some code alongs.

**Thoughts:** 
JavaScript and debugging it with different breakpoints went a bit over my head.
It seems quite complicated.
