# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Rebeccode]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 19th, Saturday 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 Saturday January 19th 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Cloned the 100 Days of Code repository to my local machine.
Working on the Odin Project Web Dev 101 - Dev Resources.
I reviewed some things about using Dev Tools and did some code alongs.

**Thoughts:** 
JavaScript and debugging it with different breakpoints went a bit over my head.
It seems quite complicated.

Learned about Debugging JavaScript with breakpoints:

### R1D2 Sunday January 20th 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Working on Odin Project JavaScript fundamentals 3. Working on JavaScript functions.
Went through some MDN tutorials and cloned the repository to my local machine to work on the code-alongs.

**Thoughts:** 
I can understand some bits of functions. The issue about scope (global and local scope for variables) makes sense.

### R1D3 Monday January 21st 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Working on Odin Project JavaScript fundamentals 3. Working on JavaScript functions.
Finished the required reading and made notes.

**Thoughts:** 
Found the tasks from JavaScript.info really tough and couldn't solve some of them at all.

### R1D4 Tuesday January 22nd 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Finished Odin Project JavaScript fundamentals 3.
Made a new repository for building the rock, paper, scissors game for the next lesson of Odin.

**Thoughts:** 
Found the reading from days 1-3 made more sense today, and I solved the problems at the end of
JavaScript fundamentals 3 quickly, so I feel good today!

### R1D5 Wednesday January 23rd 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Working on coding the Rock, Paper, Scissors game task from the Odin Project.
In an hour and a half I managed to write the computer play and the user play by myself (with a bunch of re-reading and googling) but without gooling "rock, paper, scissors" JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** 
Felt overwhelmed at first. But I broke it down and thought about what I wanted to do (like choose a random one from rock, paper or scissors) and what I know already and how to achieve it.

### R1D6 Thursday January 24th 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Finished coding the Rock, Paper, Scissors game task from the Odin Project.
In an hour and a half I managed to write the repeat 5 times function, the calculating score function, and get it all working.

**Thoughts:** 
Felt overwhelmed at first. But I broke it down and thought about what I wanted to do and what I know already and how to achieve it. Plus frantic googling about loops.
I finally feel like something with JavaScript has clicked. And the pure focus I have for an hour an a half trying to do what I want to is really motivating for me.

### R1D7 Friday January 25th 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Finished Web Dev 101 clean coding lesson on Odin and made notes. Reading up about JavaScript arrays.

**Thoughts:** 
Feel sleepy just reading articles on Friday night after work.

### R1D8 Saturday January 26th 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Finished the reading about JavaScript arrays. Read about loops and doing the active learning tasks.

**Thoughts:** 
I knew a little about these topics already, but I understand them more now.

### R1D9 Sunday January 27th 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Finished the tasks for Loops. It was tricky and I made a few mistakes, kept a record of them to review again later.
I started the Test Driven Development part of the Odin lesson.
Installed NPM, jasmine and node from the command line to run tests on JavaScript files I need to fix.

**Thoughts:** 
I feel like the JavaScript I write is always bad compared with the model answers. But that's part of learning!

### R1D10 Tuesday January 29th 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Was ill with a migraine after work last night so I couldn't do anything. I'm back coding for an hour after work today.
Made the "repeat string" code for JavaScript and tested it using Jasmine on the command line.
Not sure if I did it right, so I asked a question in the Odin Project chatroom.

**Thoughts:** 
Definitely having 100 days of code as a motivator has made me come back today after being ill yesterday.
Still unsure and feeling unconfident. JavaScript and the logic is not so intuitive to me, so I keep making silly mistakes. But I know it's part of learning.

### R1D11 Wednesday January 30th 2019
**Today's Progress:**
- Reversed a string
- 

**Thoughts:** 
Fit in studying between work and other commitments for an hour. It shows I can do it with a bit of forethought and planning!
Felt good to figure out the JavaScript exercise much quicker than yesterday!

### R1D12 Friday February 1st 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Stuck on JavaScript exercise about removing things from an array and making my code pass all the tests.

**Thoughts:** 
Learned a lot today but still super stuck. A bit frustrating but I'll keep working through it.

### R1D13 Saturday February 2nd 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Super stuck on the same JavaScript exercise for a few hours. Looked in Odin forums and found I wasn't the only one. I learned more about the concepts involved, but I never would have been able to figure that out by myself.
I solved the next problem super easily and quickly! Just shows how long it can take if I haven't got the core concepts of the problem down yet.

**Thoughts:** 
Learned a lot today. Feel like I want to make more progress more quickly, but get stuck so easily!

### R1D14 Sunday February 3rd 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Moved on to DOM Manipulation using JavaScript today. Did the exercises about adding elements to the DOM and styling them.


**Thoughts:** 
I already forgot a lot of the things I'd learned with CSS and the ways to change styles. Reviewing often is so important!

### R1D15 Monday February 4th 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Followed the tutorial from JavaScript 30 to make the drumkit. It was good to code along and I made a few mistakes which consolidated the structure of the code. I set up for creating my own UI for the rock, paper, scissors I coded before.

**Thoughts:** 
Wish I had more time in the day to code! Around 2 hours or so is not enough!

### R1D16 Tuesday February 5th 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Editing JavaScript to make the rock, paper, scissors work.
JavaScript logic working now with console.log - need to change to DOM methods to show the score on the webpage tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** 
Had a tiring day, so coding at night after work was rough.

### R1D17 Friday February 8th 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Changed rock paper scissors consolelogs to to DOM methods to show the score on the webpage.

**Thoughts:** 
Last two days were busy and crazy with work. It was hard to get back into the code after two days away from it, but I managed to do what I wanted to today.

### R1D18 Saturday February 9th 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Editing the rock-paper-scissors a little. Re-studying about responsive web design as I'm planning to make it look nicer with CSS next.

**Thoughts:** 
Enjoying coding and putting everything together without a tutorial or walkthrough.

A long way to go, but I made progress today.

### R1D21 Saturday February 16th 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Started working on creating my own portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** 
I have to force myself to slow down, think, research and plan carefully before just trying to build! But it has been going well because of that. So much I have to learn!

### R1D22 Sunday February 17th 2019

Almost finished work on my portfolio website.
It took many hours today, but I have my basic portfolio landing page looking the way I want. Did a quick Japanese translation.
Going to tidy it up tomorrow!

Feeling good that I have put together a lot that I've learned so far.
