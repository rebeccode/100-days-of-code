The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 19th, Saturday 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 Saturday January 19th 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Cloned the 100 Days of Code repository to my local machine.
Working on the Odin Project Web Dev 101 - Dev Resources.
I reviewed some things about using Dev Tools and did some code alongs.

**Thoughts:** 
JavaScript and debugging it with different breakpoints went a bit over my head.
It seems quite complicated.

### R1D2 Sunday January 20th 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Working on Odin Project JavaScript fundamentals 3. Working on JavaScript functions.
Went through some MDN tutorials and cloned the repository to my local machine to work on the code-alongs.

**Thoughts:** 
I can understand some bits of functions. The issue about scope (global and local scope for variables) makes sense.

### R1D4 Tuesday January 22nd 2019
**Today's Progress:**
Finished Odin Project JavaScript fundamentals 3.
Made a new repository for building the rock, paper, scissors game for the next lesson of Odin.

**Thoughts:** 
Found the reading from days 1-3 made more sense today, and I solved the problems at the end of
JavaScript fundamentals 3 quickly, so I feel good today!
